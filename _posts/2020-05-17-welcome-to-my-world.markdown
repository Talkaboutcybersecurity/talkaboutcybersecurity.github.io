Welcome to `Talk about Cyber Security website.` This website results from an idea that came to my mind a long time ago, and I'm happy to have time to implement it finally.

<!--more-->

Like some people, I often use note-taking applications every day. I record everything, from knowledge, workflows, thoughts, and perspectives on growing my job and my company, life notes, journey, etc. I have recently transferred my notes to markdown format by using tools like Notion and Joplin, and I have found it convenient to maintain writing notes with markdown. So, I started thinking about why I didn’t create a blog to store and share essential notes among them. With Jekyll, I can quickly turn my daily messages into an article on the website without losing much time. Yes, the primary purpose is to store, but I also hope that the knowledge in some of my notes can help someone or make someone feel like reading them. That is why this website was born.

Because the articles on this site are derived from my notes, so it’s no surprise if you find some of them as one-way thoughts or maybe it’s inaccurate (read more in [Disclaimer](/Disclaimer)). However, you can contribute to correcting them or expressing your opinion and your reaction below the articles.

I also want to share my projects with the community through this website, projects that I have completed or are still working on. Sometimes I will share ideas that I haven’t had time to implement so that anyone in the community who finds them attractive can help me realize those ideas. I’m a person with many ideas, but because of time or because I’m too lazy to complete all of them.

For what helped me create this site, I would like to thank [Pixis (Hackndo)](https://en.hackndo.com/) - one of my favorite cybersecurity blogs since most of the custom template from my website has been implemented based on the front end of Hackndo. PlaceIt](https://placeit.net/) creates the logo of my website. And, of course, this entire website is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)..

Lastly, I want to thank you for visiting my website. I hope you will have a good experience with it.
