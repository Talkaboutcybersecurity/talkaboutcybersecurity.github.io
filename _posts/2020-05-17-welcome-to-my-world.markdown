Welcome to `Talk about Cyber Security` website. This website is the result of an idea that came to my mind long time ago and I'm happy to finally have time to implement it.

<!--more-->

Like some people, I often use note-taking applications every day. I record everything, from knowledge, workflows, thoughts and perspectives on growing my job and my company, life notes, my journey, etc. Recently I have completely transferred my notes to markdown format by using tools like Notion and Joplin, and I have found it convenient to maintain writing notes with markdown. So, I started thinking why I didn't create a blog to store and share important notes among them. With Jekyll, I can easily turn my daily notes into an article on the website without losing much time. Yes, the main purpose is to store, but I also hope that the knowledge in some of my notes can help someone, or at least make someone feel like reading them. That is why this website was born.

Because the articles on this site are derived from my notes, so it's no surprise if you find some of them as one-way thoughts or maybe it's inaccurate (read more in [Disclaimer](/Disclaimer)). However, you can contribute to me to correct them or express your opinion and/or your reaction below the articles.

Through this website, I also want to share my projects with the community, projects that I have completed or are still working on. Sometimes I will share ideas that I haven't had time to implement so that anyone in the community who finds it interesting can help me realize those ideas. I'm a person with a lot of ideas, but because of time or because I'm too lazy to complete all of them.

For what helped me create this site, I would like to thank [Pixis (Hackndo)](https://en.hackndo.com/) - one of my favorite cybersecurity blogs, since most of the custom template from my website has been implemented based on the front end of Hackndo. The logo of my website is created by [PlaceIt](https://placeit.net/). And of course, this entire website is built on the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Lastly, I want to thank you for visiting my website. Hope you will have a good experience with it.
