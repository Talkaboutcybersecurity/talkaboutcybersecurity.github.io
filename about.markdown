## About my blog

Welcome to `Talk about Cyber Security website.` This website is the result of an idea that came to my mind a long time ago. The primary purpose is to store my notes about everything in my life and work. You can find my knowledge, thoughts, and opinions through the articles on this site. But I also hope that the experience in some of my notes can help someone or make someone feel like reading them. That is why this website was born. Please read the article [Welcome to My World](/2020-05-17-welcome-to-my-world) for a better understanding.

## Who am I

My name is `Nguyen Truong Phu` (My first name is Phu), sometimes people call me `Tony`. I’m currently working in the field of Cybersecurity. I have been through many various positions in this field, from the blue team to the red team. However, I still prefer offensive positions. At the time of writing this article, I am working in Vietnam. I have had the good fortune to work in some other countries in Southeast Asia. However, I still haven’t had a chance to work in the US and Europe.

Daily work makes me work a lot with offensive security in mobile apps and operating systems and infrastructure. Currently, I mainly research automated hacking and use automation to increase the effectiveness of offensive security jobs. However, I also like studying big data, machine learning.

Besides technology, I also have a particular interest in business development research.

I think some information here is enough for you to know about me. Next, maybe you'll probably want to start reading my articles and hope you enjoy them.
