## About my blog

Welcome to `Talk about Cyber Security` website. This website is the result of an idea that came to my mind long time ago, the main purpose is to store my notes about everything in my life and work. You can find my knowledge, thoughts and opinions through the articles on this site. But I also hope that the knowledge in some of my notes can help someone, or at least make someone feel like reading them. That is why this website was born. Read the article [Welcome to My World](/2020-05-17-welcome-to-my-world) for a better understanding

## Who am I

My name is `Nguyen Truong Phu` (My first name is Phu), sometimes people call me `Tony`. I'm currently working in the field of Cyber security. I have been through many different positions in this field, from the blue team to the red team. However, I still prefer offensive positions. At the time of writing this article I am working in `Vietnam`. I have had the good fortune to work in a number of other countries in Southeast Asia. However, I still haven't had a chance to work in the US and Europe.

Daily work makes me work a lot with security in mobile apps and operating systems, along with infrastructure offensive. Currently I mainly research on automated hacking and use the power of automation to increase the effectiveness of offensive jobs. However, I also like studying big data, machine learning.

Besides technology, I also have a special interest in business development research.

I think some information here is enough for you to know about me. Next, maytbe you'll probably want to start reading my articles and hope you enjoy them.
